# Virtual-Laptop-Assistant-AI-Assistant-
It is software based AI project developed in Python using pyCharm IDE. The laptop assistant can do various tasks and automations just by giving voice commands.
AI Assistant accepts voice commands and converts that speech into text format.
The Assistant finds the trigger word in the text and after finding that trigger word it executes the particular automation based on the trigger word.
For example: Assistant please open youtube
Here open youtube is a trigger word and as soon as assistant finds it, youtube opens in new window.
